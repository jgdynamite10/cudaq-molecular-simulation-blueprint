# Results interpretation

## What the charts show

The `/compare` page (and the JSON written by `cudaq-bp bench compare`) renders
two views per molecule:

1. **Wall time per run** - mean ± standard error across seeds, per backend.
2. **Absolute error vs reference** - on a log scale, one bar per backend.

Both views are derived from the per-run manifests, which already contain
the fields. There is no derived "secret sauce" - the JSON is the chart.

## What the numbers mean

| field                          | meaning                                                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `wall_time_seconds`            | total time the optimizer ran on that backend, end to end             |
| `time_per_evaluation_ms`       | wall_time / function_evaluations - per-statevector throughput proxy  |
| `iterations`                   | outer COBYLA iterations until termination                            |
| `error_vs_reference_hartree`   | `final_energy - reference_energy` (Hartree)                          |
| `chemical_accuracy_reached`    | `\|error\| < 1.6 mHa`                                                 |

`speedups` in the comparison report quote the ratio of CPU mean wall time
to each non-CPU backend's mean wall time, e.g. `cpu_over_gpu_fp64_wall_time`.

## What the numbers do NOT mean

This project is built around very specific framing. The charts are evidence
of a hybrid quantum-classical workflow being practical *today on GPU
infrastructure*, not evidence of any of the following:

- **Quantum advantage.** None of these workloads are at quantum-advantage
  scale. STO-3G H2 has a 4×4 Hamiltonian; the FCI energy can be computed
  in microseconds in literally any way. We are using H2 as a *correctness*
  smoke test, not as a benchmark target.
- **GPU vs QPU.** This project does not run on a QPU. The "QPU" in the
  blog title is a future-state stand-in; today, we simulate quantum circuits
  classically (which is what the entire industry does for practical work).
- **NVIDIA vs other vendors.** No comparison against other GPU vendors,
  cloud providers, or CPU architectures is published here. The CPU path
  uses CUDA-Q's own `qpp-cpu` so the only thing changing between backends is
  the simulator target string.
- **Akamai vs other clouds.** This project does not run on other clouds for
  v1 and makes no claim about cross-cloud performance.

## Reading the bond-distance results

The bond distance matters: VQE is a function minimizer of energy *at a fixed
geometry*. Picking a geometry far from equilibrium will give a higher
energy - that's not a bug. The reference energy in the manifest is matched
against the same geometry, so the *error* column is the apples-to-apples
quantity to compare.

## Reading active-space results

For LiH the default active space is `(2 active electrons, 5 active
orbitals)` with the lithium 1s frozen as core. The Hamiltonian itself
applies the active-space restriction; the **ansatz**, however, is
currently instantiated against the full LiH molecule (n_qubits=12,
n_electrons=4, 92 UCCSD parameters), so the multi-seed bench manifests
record 12-qubit / 92-parameter circuits even for the active-space
problem. In a tighter v0.2 implementation the ansatz will be restricted
to match the active space (10 qubits, ~24 parameters); the reference
energies in `app/quantum/reference_data.py` will be unchanged because
they are properties of the Hamiltonian, not the ansatz.

The reference table in `app/quantum/reference_data.py` was recomputed
via PySCF on 2026-05-04 (`pyscf.mcscf.CASCI`) so chemical accuracy is
measured against PySCF-derived values rather than a literature
estimate. For LiH/STO-3G at the equilibrium geometry, CASCI(2e,5o) and
full FCI are only 0.227 mHa apart, so the active-space approximation
is not the limiting factor: any error larger than ~1 mHa is optimizer /
ansatz residual.

The 2026-05-04 multi-seed bench reflects this. With 1500 COBYLA
iterations, two of three seeds (42, 43) converge to within 1.1 mHa of
each other but stop ~5.8&ndash;6.9 mHa above CASCI(2e,5o); the third
seed (44) lands ~126 mHa above in a separate basin. None of these
runs reach chemical accuracy. The path to closing the gap is a
combination of (a) a properly active-space-restricted ansatz,
(b) gradient-based optimization (parameter-shift L-BFGS-B), and
(c) running longer. None of those is a vendor problem; they are
engineering choices the project will revisit in a follow-up post.

## Sample size and noise

Each run is deterministic for a given seed (COBYLA is seeded; CUDA-Q
statevector simulation is deterministic). The "noise" reflected in
`stderr` columns therefore comes from optimizer-initial-condition variance
across different seeds, not stochastic shot noise. We deliberately use
`shots=0` (i.e. exact statevector observable) for this study; shot-based
runs would introduce another axis of variance that's outside the v1 scope.
