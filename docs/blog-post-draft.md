## Why this work, and why now

Most organizations will encounter quantum computing for the first time
through their classical infrastructure, not by pointing a workload at a
QPU. The near-term loop &mdash; model a system, build a circuit, optimize
parameters, evaluate the result against a Hamiltonian many thousands of
times &mdash; is overwhelmingly hybrid CPU + GPU work today. A QPU
becomes one execution target eventually; classical accelerators are the
substrate now.

That made me want to see the workflow concretely &mdash; not on a slide,
but provisioned, run, captured, and torn down on infrastructure I can
hand to anyone else. The companion repository,
[`cudaq-molecular-simulation-blueprint`](https://github.com/jgdynamite/cudaq-molecular-simulation-blueprint),
is the result: a small reference implementation of the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) for two textbook molecules, built on NVIDIA's
[CUDA-Q](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/) and
[cuQuantum](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk)'s `cuStateVec`,
validated end-to-end on Akamai Cloud RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs.

This post is meant as a field note. Where do current-generation GPUs
help the hybrid quantum workflow, where don't they, and how do you
evaluate that question for your own organization without leaning on
vendor narrative? The practical value in this space starts with
experimentation, validation, and shortening time-to-decision &mdash;
long before any QPU hours are booked. CUDA-Q's `nvidia-fp64` target
runs the whole VQE loop &mdash; circuit construction, expectation
evaluation, parameter update &mdash; on the GPU with the optimizer on
the CPU; you don't write any CUDA, you write quantum kernels in
CUDA-Q's Python frontend and pick a target.

## Why ITDMs should care

Quantum computing tends to enter executive conversations as a
future-tense topic. The near-term reality is more useful and more
mundane: the workflow is already running, on classical infrastructure,
mostly on GPUs that organizations are already provisioning for AI
training and inference.

Three takeaways for someone evaluating where this fits in an
infrastructure portfolio:

- **GPU optionality extends beyond AI inference.** The same
  Blackwell-class accelerators that drive ML serving today are the
  simulation substrate for hybrid quantum algorithms. That is worth
  knowing when sizing capacity, planning utilization, or framing the
  return on accelerator investment.
- **Evidence over narrative, by construction.** The repository is
  small, but it ships every artifact: host fingerprint, full
  convergence traces, RNG seeds, container digest, git SHA, and
  multi-seed wall-time measurements with stderr. That posture &mdash;
  publish what you ran, on what hardware, with what variance &mdash;
  is the way to evaluate emerging accelerated workloads responsibly,
  and it generalizes well past quantum.
- **A technical infrastructure thesis, not a platform claim.** The
  takeaway here is that Blackwell-class GPUs are a viable platform
  for the hybrid quantum workloads available today, and Akamai Cloud
  is one validated path to running them. That is a technical thesis
  with reproducible evidence behind it. It is not a quantum-advantage
  claim, and it is not a positioning of Akamai as a dedicated quantum
  cloud.

The rest of this post walks through the experiment that supports those
takeaways and the places where the data complicated my own thinking.

## The setup: H2 and LiH on a real Blackwell

The blueprint targets two textbook molecules, picked to bracket the
regime where a small statevector simulation transitions from
CPU-dominated to GPU-dominated work:

- **H<sub>2</sub>** at 0.74 &Aring; bond length, sto-3g basis, 4 qubits,
  3 UCCSD parameters. Maps to a small Hamiltonian where everything fits
  comfortably in CPU registers.
- **LiH** at 1.5957 &Aring; bond length, sto-3g basis, 2-electron /
  5-orbital active space, 12 qubits, 92 UCCSD parameters. Big enough that
  the statevector starts to be interesting on its own.

The driver is plain CUDA-Q + Python. Chemistry preprocessing uses
[OpenFermion](https://quantumai.google/openfermion) and
[PySCF](https://pyscf.org/) to produce a CUDA-Q `Hamiltonian`; the ansatz
is the bundled `cudaq.kernels.uccsd`; the optimizer is SciPy's COBYLA so
the comparison stays in plain classical optimizer territory. The whole
loop is a couple hundred lines of typed Python with full manifest and
trace capture for every run.

What changes between the CPU and GPU runs is the value of one string:

```python
# CPU
cudaq.set_target("qpp-cpu")

# GPU (FP64 cuStateVec)
cudaq.set_target("nvidia", option="fp64")
```

The hardware host is an Akamai Cloud `g3-gpu-rtxpro6000-blackwell-1`
instance in the Jakarta (`id-cgk`) region, provisioned and torn down
with Terraform + Ansible: NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition,
driver `580.159.03` (the open kernel module branch &mdash; required for
Blackwell), CUDA 13.0, 96 GB VRAM, 16 vCPU, 172 GB system RAM. The full
deployment is one Terraform apply plus one Ansible playbook, all gated
behind an SSH key that exists only for the bench cycle. The numbers
below come from a multi-seed re-bench done on 2026-05-04 (3 RNG seeds
per backend, 15 specs total): VM lifetime was 2 h 27 min of compute
plus ~30 min of bootstrap, billed at ~$3.00/hr.

## Results (multi-seed, n=3 per backend)

Every backend was run with seeds 42, 43, 44 on the same Blackwell host.
Full manifests and traces live under
[`results/akamai-blackwell-multiseed/`](https://github.com/jgdynamite/cudaq-molecular-simulation-blueprint/tree/main/results/akamai-blackwell-multiseed)
in the repo. Headline aggregates:

| Molecule | Backend | n | Wall (s) mean &plusmn; stderr | Energy mean (Ha) | min &#124;err vs ref&#124; (mHa) |
|---|---|:-:|---:|---:|---:|
| H<sub>2</sub>  | `qpp-cpu`     | 3 | **16.87 &plusmn; 0.83** | -1.137270 | < 0.001 |
| H<sub>2</sub>  | `nvidia:fp32` | 3 | **12.98 &plusmn; 0.39** | -1.137265 | 0.002 |
| H<sub>2</sub>  | `nvidia:fp64` | 3 |   17.65 &plusmn; 1.08    | -1.137270 | < 0.001 |
| LiH | `qpp-cpu`     | 3 |   1809.12 &plusmn; 7.03 | -7.835907 | 12.74 |
| LiH | `nvidia:fp64` | 3 | **1086.56 &plusmn; 4.19** | -7.835907 | 12.74 |

Two stories show up in the data, and they both matter.

### Small problem: the GPU is not always the right tool

For a 4-qubit Hamiltonian the CPU statevector backend
(`qpp-cpu`, OpenMP-parallel, 16 cores) finished H<sub>2</sub> in
16.87 &plusmn; 0.83 s. The GPU FP64 path took 17.65 &plusmn; 1.08 s
&mdash; **0.96&times;** of CPU, well within stderr. The FP32 GPU path
finished in 12.98 &plusmn; 0.39 s for a 1.30&times; speedup; the
lighter precision overhead pays off on a 16-amplitude statevector.

Multi-seed visibility makes a useful observation precise: at 4 qubits,
host&hairsp;-&hairsp;device transfer and kernel-launch overhead is
enough by itself for a top-of-line Blackwell to trail a 16-core CPU.
CUDA-Q is doing the right thing; the GPU simply does not have enough
actual work on a 16-amplitude statevector to amortize its setup cost.
The general form of this finding is what matters: **GPU acceleration
has a problem-size threshold below which the device is overhead, not
acceleration.** Choosing the right tool for the size of the problem is
part of the engineering work, and reporting both regimes honestly is
part of evaluating the workload responsibly.

### Larger problem: GPU is 1.665&times; faster, with tight error bars

LiH on a 12-qubit, 92-parameter UCCSD ansatz tells a different story.
Both backends ran to the 1500-iteration COBYLA cap. The wall-time gap
opens up cleanly:

- CPU: 1809.12 &plusmn; 7.03 s, 1206.08 ms per function evaluation.
- GPU FP64: **1086.56 &plusmn; 4.19 s**, **724.38 ms per function
  evaluation**.

That's a **1.665&times;** wall-time speedup, with stderr around 0.4%
relative on each backend &mdash; the speedup itself is a tight
measurement, not a single observation that happens to land where you
hope. The convergence chart is identical under the optimizer's view
(same x0 per seed, deterministic FP64 math), the GPU just gets through
each iteration faster:

![LiH convergence on Blackwell](images/04-result-lih-gpu.png)

This is the regime where the GPU pays its own freight. The 12-qubit
statevector is 4096 complex amplitudes per evaluation, the Hamiltonian
has hundreds of Pauli terms, and each function evaluation is doing
real work that benefits from the parallelism. The Blackwell's 96 GB of
VRAM is barely touched here &mdash; but it's the thing that makes the
next jumps (16, 18, 20-qubit active spaces with bigger basis sets)
tractable on a single card.

### Why multi-seed actually changed my read of the data

The v0.1.0 single-seed cut quoted a 1.71&times; LiH speedup on a 300-
iteration COBYLA cap. That measurement was honest, but it was also
incomplete in two specific ways, and walking through them is the heart
of why multi-seed reruns matter for any workload like this.

Trace inspection on the v0.1.0 manifest showed COBYLA was still
descending steadily at iter 300 &mdash; the last quarter of that run
dropped 0.048 Ha by itself &mdash; so the +0.283 Ha residual error
versus FCI was *not enough iterations*, not *stuck in a local
minimum*. Bumping LiH `--max-iterations` from 300 to 1500 and re-running
with three seeds turned a single anecdotal data point into something
with structure:

- 2 of 3 seeds (42, 43) converged to within 1.1 mHa of each other,
  landing at -7.875 to -7.876 Ha. UCCSD with single and double
  excitations spans the full active CI space for a 2-electron system,
  so this *is* the active-space FCI minimum.
- 1 of 3 seeds (44) hit a different local minimum at -7.756 Ha, about
  120 mHa above the converged answer.

That third seed is the real signal multi-seed buys you. UCCSD with
COBYLA is sensitive to initialization, and 1-in-3 lands in a basin you
do not want. A version of this post that quoted only seed 42 would
have given a tidier picture than the workload actually has. The
variance is real, the median is honest, and the 1.665&times; speedup
now carries credible error bars rather than a single observation that
happened to land where I hoped.

The remaining ~6&ndash;7 mHa gap between the converged seeds and the
*full* FCI energy of -7.882362 Ha is the active-space frozen-core
error, not optimizer error. Closing it calls for a bigger active space
or a richer basis, not a better optimizer.

## What this run teaches

A few takeaways that generalize beyond this specific workload.

**1. Quantum development today is hybrid by default.** The pipeline
that will eventually target a real QPU is the same pipeline that runs
on a CPU statevector or a GPU statevector now, with one configuration
value choosing the execution target. Standing up the hybrid runtime
first is the more economical path to readiness; it lets the QPU
column be added when QPUs reach an interesting working point, rather
than as a re-platforming exercise.

**2. Problem size, not vendor narrative, decides whether the GPU
helps.** Below the threshold the GPU is overhead; above it, the GPU
pays for itself in wall time and unlocks problem sizes a CPU cannot
practically reach. Knowing where the threshold is &mdash; for your
specific Hamiltonian shape, your specific ansatz, your specific
optimizer &mdash; is the engineering work. The two data points
published here are intended as a starting curve others can extend.

**3. Reproducibility belongs in the design, not the appendix.** Every
run in this project captures CUDA-Q version, GPU model, driver
version, CUDA version, OS, container digest, git SHA, and seed. The
bench tarball is attached to the GitHub release with a SHA256. Anyone
can re-run this on their own Blackwell, on their own CPU, on their
own laptop, on their own cloud. That kind of provenance is what turns
an "X is N times faster than Y" anecdote into something an
infrastructure team can act on.

**4. The artifact and the post belong together.** The
[live UI](https://cudaq-blueprint-demo.website-us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/)
is not a screenshot. It is the actual Jinja2/HTMX UI rendered as a
static bundle and served from Akamai Object Storage. Visitors see the
real Blackwell host fingerprint, drill into the convergence chart of
each individual run, and read the same comparison report the CLI
produces. The "Run an experiment" form is intentionally inert in
static mode &mdash; clicking submit redirects to the GitHub repo.
Public read-only artifacts are easy to reason about; live execution
belongs behind authentication, which is the appropriate place to
draw that line for a public companion site.

## Reproduce it yourself

CPU path, runs anywhere with Docker (~17 seconds for H<sub>2</sub>):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgdynamite/cudaq-molecular-simulation-blueprint.git
cd cudaq-molecular-simulation-blueprint
make container-build
make container-run-cpu
make serve   # local UI at http://localhost:8000
```

GPU path on Akamai Cloud (Blackwell SKU is feature-gated; talk to your
account team):

```bash
export LINODE_TOKEN=...
cd infra/terraform/akamai
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
$EDITOR terraform.tfvars   # SSH key, region (id-cgk or br-gru), label

terraform init && terraform apply
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../ansible/playbook.yml \
    --private-key ~/.ssh/your-key

ssh root@$(terraform output -raw public_ip) \
    "docker exec cudaq-blueprint cudaq-bp bench compare"

terraform destroy   # mandatory; cost meter stops
```

Total cost for the multi-seed bench cycle that produced the numbers
above: ~$10.75 for ~3.5 hours of `g3-gpu-rtxpro6000-blackwell-1` time
(15 specs &times; 3 seeds, including ~30 minutes of bootstrap and
teardown overhead). The original v0.1.0 single-seed cut was $3.84 for
1 h 17 min.

The full Terraform module, Ansible roles, and Dockerfile are in the
repo under `infra/`. The application code is provider-agnostic &mdash; you
can lift the Docker image to any GPU host that has the NVIDIA Container
Toolkit and the open kernel modules installed and the same binary will
run.

## What's next

Three things I would do before scaling these numbers up in a
follow-up post:

- **Optimizer + ansatz upgrade.** The 1-of-3 LiH local minimum is
  fixable by replacing COBYLA with L-BFGS-B and parameter-shift
  gradients. The active-space frozen-core gap (6&ndash;7 mHa to full
  FCI) is fixable by enlarging the active space. Both swaps are recipe
  changes; the rest of the pipeline doesn't move.
- **Bigger active spaces.** The same 96 GB Blackwell that yawned
  through 12 qubits will hold 28&ndash;30 qubit statevectors comfortably.
  That's the region where exact diagonalization on a CPU stops being
  practical, so it's the natural next data point.
- **Multi-GPU.** Akamai's `g3-gpu-rtxpro6000-blackwell-2` SKU has two
  cards; CUDA-Q's `nvidia-mgpu` target slices the statevector across
  them. The current comparisons were held to a single card on purpose
  &mdash; the next data point goes the other way.

What is intentionally not on this list: a quantum-advantage claim, a
cross-cloud benchmark, or an orchestration-on-Kubernetes story. Each
of those is a separate piece of work, with its own scope, audience,
and timing, and folding any of them into this post would dilute the
result.

---

## Caveats and what this isn't

- **This is not a quantum-advantage claim.** The CPU runs the same VQE
  with the same convergence; the GPU just gets through each iteration
  faster on the larger of the two molecules.
- **This is not a positioning of Akamai as a dedicated quantum cloud.**
  The point is that Akamai already has Blackwell capacity, and the
  hybrid quantum workflow runs on Blackwell, so that hybrid quantum
  workflow runs on Akamai today &mdash; same as it would on any cloud
  with Blackwell capacity.
- **The application core is provider-agnostic.** Akamai-specific
  deployment lives entirely under `infra/`. Lift the Docker image
  anywhere that has Blackwell + the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
- **The QPU column is empty by design.** Adding a QPU target is one
  CUDA-Q `set_target()` call away; I left it out so the post stays
  focused on the part of the workflow that runs on hardware available
  to anyone today. The point is that the hybrid workflow is already
  worth standing up before the QPU column has a number in it.
